Python program that produces a list of the most used words in a job description

To use the program (wordCount.py) on a Mac, follow the instructions below.<br />
Open the terminal window.<br />
Make sure Python is installed on the machine by typing "python --version" and pressing enter.<br />
Navigate to directory where program is stored (using cd command to change directories and ls to list files in each directory).<br />
Save a text (.txt) file of the job description in the same directory where the wordCount.py program is located.<br />
Enter "python wordCount.py" in the terminal window and press enter.<br />
