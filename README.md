Python program that produces a list of the most used words in a job description

To use the program (wordCount.py) on a Mac, follow the instructions below.
Open the terminal window.
Make sure Python is installed on the machine by typing "python --version" and pressing enter.
Navigate to directory where program is stored (using cd command to change directories and ls to list files in each directory).
Save a text (.txt) file of the job description in the same directory where the wordCount.py program is located.
Enter "python wordCount.py" in the terminal window and press enter.
Enter the name of the text file containing the job description (i.e. jobname.txt) when prompted and hit enter.
A Python dictionary containing a list of the most used words and the number of times they appear will be presented in the terminal window.

Note: the list of words will not contain commonly used words (such as: a, an, the, of, it, etc.) that have nothing to do with the job itself.
